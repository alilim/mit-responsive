We now carry our work, friends and interests on-the-go. The growing number of mobile devices offers opportunities for creating new experiences for mobile users everywhere.

          In this track we will learn how to be diligent while designing for mobile experiences. We will focus in detail on how context augments our experience, how information access differs across various user groups, and how mobility will change the way go about our everyday lives. We will address the diversity in form-factor of mobile devices -- phones, tablets, e-readers -- to translate our design and engineering efforts into well-crafted experiences that suit the user's environment, be it a meeting, travel, shopping, education or work.

          Teams will design and prototype well thought-out ideas that are user-centric. In short, we will not just build yet another mobile app -- we will uniquely position ourselves to question how and why we design a new mobile experience and its implications for a user who lives in this mobile device ecosystem.

                  A billion people, a billion mobile devices and a billion cameras. They are everywhere, we can't imagine a social gathering, a hangout with friends or a trip without taking hundreds of photographs. A world through the eyes of the camera opens innumerable possibilities of re-thinking ways to capture, share and augment our visual world.

          In this track we will learn how to design new cameras and create augmented visual experiences. We will focus in detail on how a camera works, how we can tweak existing cameras to capture impossible kinds of photographs and how we can use cameras to enhance human vision. We will address this overflow of imaging devices including mobile cameras, web-cameras, point and shoots and kinects to help design and implement our ideas to solve relevant social and consumer problems.

          Teams will design and implement imaging solutions for a wide-variety of questions. This track will equip teams to learn how existing and new cameras can be used to design experiences in our daily lives.

                <p style="text-align:justify;margin: 0 0 15px 0;"><img src="content/di/bangalore/tracks/Tangible user interfaces.png" width="200px" style="float:left;margin: 0px 10px 5px 0px;"/>
                 Human computer interfaces have evolved from keyboard, mouse and monitor to interactive surfaces and objects we can grasp and intuitively manipulate. Tangible user interfaces are on the forefront of this development, as they seamlessly couple the dual worlds of bits and atoms by giving physical form to digital information.

          In the course of this track, students will learn the conceptual frameworks of tangible interaction, the latest research in the field, and a variety of techniques for designing and building tangible systems. Throughout the workshop, teams will indulge in a series of short creative assignments, observing everyday interactions of humans with the physical world and each other, and apply these insights to invent new computer interfaces.

          To build and test interface prototypes, students will learn to utilize tools like Arduino, Processing and openFrameworks. These skills in interaction design and prototyping will be applied to a final group project.

                <p style="text-align:justify;margin: 0 0 15px 0;"><img src="content/di/bangalore/tracks/Sensor environments.png" width="200px" style="float:left;margin: 0px 10px 5px 0px;"/>
                  As the devices in our environment become increasingly sensor rich and deeply networked, user engagement will drift away from individual platforms. Weï¿½ll no longer focus on any one appliance in our entourage, as is the case in our current phone-dominated hegemony.

          In this track, we focus on the core sensor technologies, sensor conditioning, and interface design to inspire future engineers and designers to consider the importance of not only ""app-driven"" phone applications of sensors, but of a generic sensor-network nervous system. In effect, we argue in this workshop that although the sensor-driven applications of mobile phones are important, future systems will encompass networks and data streams much more complex than your social network.

          Moreover, we are increasingly interested in visualizing the data our networks create. In addition, we discuss existing platforms for sensor network visulization, and draw upon the fields of stochastics to allow us to model the complex behaviors often observered by our simple sensor networks. While the dream is context-aware computing, we describe the importance of not just building and reporting these datasets, but on the analysis of the information content in these networks. We also discuss the available tools and resources for carrying out these computations.

                  Even though there are newer and more advanced technologies that are used for prevention, diagnosis, treatment and management of health problems in our world today, those resources are not readily available for people in the developing world.

          In addition to these expensive tools (Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Laser Scanners, etc), we are equipped with ubiquitous technology like the cellphone that have capabilities to provide a much improved diagnosis and treatment options to the poor. Today, with open source software, we can take images with our cellphone camera to regenerate 3D images for prosthetic design and we can use software and low-cost hardware for cellphones to diagnose eye problems.

          We in this track will identify health challenges which can be solved with local and readily available technology we find in our communities. By the end of the workshop, participants will be ready to develop or improve on prototypes of their solutions
