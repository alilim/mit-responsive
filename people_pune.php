    at the MIT Media Lab, where he directs the Responsive Environments
    group, which explores how sensor networks augment and mediate human
    experience, interaction, and perception. In addition, he co-directs
    the Things That Think Consortium, a group of industry sponsors and
    Media Lab researchers who explore the extreme fringe of embedded
    computation, communication, and sensing.

    After two years developing precision drift chambers at the Lab for
    High Energy Physics at ETH in Zurich, he joined the Draper Laboratory,
    where his research encompassed spacecraft control systems, image
    processing algorithms, underwater sonar, and precision alignment
    sensors for large high-energy physics detectors. He joined the Media
    Lab in 1994, where his current research interests include embedded
    sensing systems and sensor networks, wearable and body sensor
    networks, energy harvesting and power management for embedded sensors,
    ubiquitous and pervasive computing, localization systems, passive and
    RFID sensor architectures, human-computer interfaces, and interactive
    media. His honors include the 2000 Discover Magazine Award for
    Technological Innovation, and he has authored 200 articles and
    technical reports on topics ranging from computer music to power
    scavenging.

    After receiving a BS in electrical engineering and physics summa cum
    laude from Tufts University, Paradiso became a K.T. Compton fellow at
    the Lab for Nuclear Science at MIT, receiving his PhD in physics there
    for research conducted at CERN in Geneva.</p>

        Laboratories in 2008 as head of the Lab&#39;s Camera Culture research
        group. His research interests span the fields of computational
        photography, inverse problems in imaging, and human-computer
        interaction. Recent inventions include transient imaging to look
        around a corner, a next-generation CAT-scan machine, imperceptible
        markers for motion capture (Prakash), long-distance barcodes (Bokode),
        touch + hover 3D interaction displays (BiDi screen), low-cost eye care
        devices (NETRA) and new theoretical models to augment light fields
        (ALF) to represent wave phenomena.

        In 2004, Raskar received the TR100 Award from Technology Review,
        presented to top young innovators under the age of 35, and in 2003,
        the Global Indus Technovator Award, instituted at MIT to recognize the
        top 20 Indian technology innovators worldwide. In 2009, he was awarded
        a Sloan Research Fellowship. In 2010, he received the DARPA Young
        Faculty award. He holds more than 40 US patents, and has received four
        Mitsubishi Electric Invention Awards. He is currently co-authoring a
        book on computational photography.

    M.Sc. Degree in Physics from the Allahabad University in 1950, Ph.D.
    degree in the Electrical Engineering Dept. from Stanford University in
    1961 and was awarded D.Sc. by the Roorkee, Benaras and Raipur
    Universities.

    After 2 years in Australia and 7 years in the USA (one year as
    Research Associate at Harvard University and 6 years at Stanford
    including 2 years as a Faculty), he returned to India in 1963 to join
    the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research at Mumbai as Associate
    Professor and retired in 1994 as Professor of Eminence. He was Project
    Director of the GMRT during 1987-1996.

    During the 1960's he built the 530m long and 30m wide radio telescope
    of unique design at Ooty. Later during 1987-1989, he conceived and got
    built the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope near Narayangaon about 80 km
    north of Pune. GMRT is the world's largest radio telescope working at
    longer wavelengths. It has been designed fully indigenously for
    solving many mysteries of the origin and evolution of the Universe. He
    has published over 115 research papers and edited 4 books. He has two
    patents.

    configuration of synchronous social spaces. He has worked both on ways
    to augment physical environments to create new social possibilities as
    well as virtual worlds that expand our ideas about how they can be
    used for meetings, presentations, and play. Past projects have
    explored identity issues in online games, sharing presence and
    location on mobile devices, and collaboration technologies. Before
    joining the Media Lab, he was a member of the inaugural class at Olin
    College and received a BS in electrical and computer engineering. He
    has worked in the research labs at IBM, Sun, and Motorola and founded
    Thinkature &#45; a web collaboration startup.</p>

    vision to detect human emotion, development of robots to teach
    preschool children language, use of machine vision to assist with the
    recognition of basic expressions by children diagnosed with autism,
    and blended tangible-digital games to help children diagnosed with
    autism become comfortable with eye contact and expression recognition.
    His current works include exploration of configurable stories for
    teaching children about social scenarios and the development of highly
    configurable alternative communication channels for individuals with
    communication challenges.</p>
