His undergrad background at DAIICT was a mixture of computer science, signal processing and arts, followed by a Master's degree in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) from Georgia Tech. He then worked for a couple of years at Nokia Research building interactive visualizations using large-scale real-time data sets. He is most happy working on multi-disciplinary projects, and usually likes to pick up necessary skills for any project along the way. At the Media Lab, he hopes to delve deeper (beyond the visual layer) into some new territories like the human mind, or motion of planetary bodies, or digital democracy, or new design patterns for cities. His goal is to understand and share knowledge about such data-rich domains by way of crafting creative models using multiple media.<br>
Deepak is a two-time national winner &amp; world finalist of the Microsoft Imagine Cup (a global software design competition for students), and also a winner of the Texas Instruments DSP Product Design Challenge.
