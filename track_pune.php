                  will be placed on our cellphones, computers, cars, houses, machinery,
                  robots and perhaps our bodies as well. How can we best capture the
                  visual information in different times, localities, wavelengths,
                  polarizations and viewpoints to help humans better understand this
                  world?

                  The answer is computational imaging. Computational imaging starts
                  where image processing ends. This paradigm has opened new
                  opportunities for applications beyond just picture taking &#45; for
                  instance, refocusing an image after it has been captured, getting 3D
                  shapes of scenes in a single shot and looking around corners. In this
                  track we will explore technology that uses cameras in novel ways &#45;
                  altering the hardware of capture systems to learn more from the scenes
                  we capture; retrofitting a camera with a coded mask in front of the
                  aperture to extend the capabilities of image processing techniques;
                  Kinect cameras for applications in depth sensing; cameras interacting
                  with ubiquitous tags such as, Bokodes; exploiting the trend of cameras
                  everywhere to create useful image mash-ups; reading your opponents
                  card (that you once thought was only a magic trick), and more!

                <p style="text-align:justify;margin: 0 0 15px 0;"><img src="content/di/pune/tracks/Living Mobile.jpg" width="200px" style="float:left;margin: 0px 10px 5px 0px;"/>Mobile devices have turned the world beyond our desks into venues for
          exciting new interactions. We no longer need to be in front of our
          computers or laptops to interact with our friends, colleagues, and
          information &#45; they can now easily come with us wherever we are.

          In this track, we'll design and build prototypes of new applications
          for living mobile. We'll look both at large scale mobility where
          applications use your current location to tailor an appropriate
          experience for your location as well a small scale mobility around the
          house or office where we can use mobile devices to augment social
          situations of all kind. We'll use web technologies to present these
          applications on mobile devices, use sensors to better understand our
          environments, and use techniques from data visualization and user
          interface design to think about how best to create our systems.

            sentient, competent robots, taking over tasks from pilots to lovers.
            In reality, technology is employed more as an extension of man,
            augmenting the human ability to remember, travel, build. Currently,
            tools for human augmentation are often mass-produced, and do not
            always fit their user that well. However, the rise of low-cost
            manufacturing and improved CAD/CAM interfaces enable more personalised
            human augmentation. In this workshop we will explore making
            appropriate extensions for human ability. We will touch on robotics
            and biomechanics of humans, and design and build physical prototypes
            that help or augment humans. In particular, we will be using the
            fabrication tools provided in the Fab Lab to design and build everyday
            technology for patients suffering from cerebral palsy.

          transmission of the human experience. Stories preserve history, teach,
          embody cultural identity, provide a medium for conversing with one
          another, and entertain. As human culture has advanced the art of
          storytelling has not only employed advancing technologies to re-craft
          narratives, but has helped create new technologies to tell stories in
          more fantastic and imaginative ways.

          A story can take many forms, including: visual storytelling, music and
          audio, live interactions, video games, interactive environments, data
          or process visualizations, and collaborative stories to name a few.
          These different forms require specific mediums and technologies to
          convey their message. We will review the history and current state of
          technology in relation to storytelling, while we explore and develop
          new process, mediums, and technologies for telling stories in the
          future.
