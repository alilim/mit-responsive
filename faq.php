Additionally, whatever skill set you possess (and write about) we expect a certain level of fluency in that domain. Projects are a useful resource to understanding your work and experience in your areas of interest. Ideas that you have been thinking about also give us a clue about how inter-disciplinary your approach is and how they fit in the workshop. Having a web page is always a good idea to showcase your work, but is not mandatory.</p>
