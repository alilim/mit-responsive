                <hr>
                <p style="text-align:justify;margin: 0 0 15px 0;"><img src="content/di/delhi/tracks/designing-for-interaction.jpg" width="200px" style="float:left;margin: 0px 10px 5px 0px;"/>Designing for Interaction takes a focused look at how the choices we make as designers influence how people use products. Small choices about shape, color, size of the objects we use, as well as the sorts of input and output we support have an outsize impact on how products are perceived and used. In this track, we will draw our inspiration from observing people in a real-world context and intervene with simple, single-purpose objects that address a specific need. Students will hone their interaction design skills through a series of short creative assignments that culminate in a final group project that proposes a well-thought-out and novel interaction experience.

                <p style="text-align:justify;margin: 0 0 15px 0;"><img src="content/di/delhi/tracks/imaging-on-steroids.jpg" width="200px" style="float:left;margin: 0px 10px 5px 0px;"/>This track proposes to create an entirely new class of imaging platforms that have an understanding far exceeding human ability to produce meaningful abstractions well within human comprehensibility. With more than a billion people now networked we are seeing a rapid revolution in activities based on visual exchange. This track would enable participants to exploit the potential of these billion cameras placed on our cell-phones, cars, houses perhaps our bodies, to best capture and display visual information. We will explore technology that both uses cameras and displays in novel ways, to look around corners, single shot 3D capture, post-capture refocusing of photographs, glass-free 3D displays, visual social interfacing, collaborative imaging and much more.

                <p style="text-align:justify;margin: 0 0 15px 0;"><img src="content/di/delhi/tracks/living-mobile.jpg" width="200px" style="float:left;margin: 0px 10px 5px 0px;"/>The Living Mobile track focuses on designing interfaces and experiences for groups of people on the move. Mobile devices have made computing relevant throughout our daily lives, not just when we're sitting at a desk. This has created incredible opportunities to connect groups of friends, colleagues, and strangers in real time or asynchronously, wherever they are in the world. In this track, we will explore this design space and think about how we can build systems with a strong social foundation to help people relate to each other, communicate, collaborate and play throughout their day. We're interested in groups of all sizes, from families to urban-scale mass-communication.

                <hr>
                <p style="text-align:justify;margin: 0 0 15px 0;"><img src="content/di/delhi/tracks/sensor-mediated-environments.jpg" width="200px" style="float:left;margin: 0px 10px 5px 0px;"/>This track proposes new strategies in creating intuitive, customizable interfaces for human-computer interaction through inventing cutting-edge sensor technologies. Imagine the ability to add sensing capabilities such as multi-touch, proximity, pressure and light cheaply on top of any surface you wish. Imagine the possibility of turning any existing everyday object into your generic controller for multimedia applications (gaming, music) or automation systems (lighting, robotics). In this track, we will provide participants a broad introduction to state-of-the-art sensing techniques, interaction design and practical experience that will assist in developing and implementing such systems in their own work. Our goal is to create versatile tools that enable anyone to create their own devices for interfacing the real-world with the digital world. We will encourage participants to sketch and/or build prototypes based on open-source hardware and software.

                <p style="text-align:justify;margin: 0 0 15px 0;"><img src="content/di/delhi/tracks/design-for-sustainability.jpg" width="200px" style="float:left;margin: 0px 10px 5px 0px;"/>The accelerating process of globalization and liberalization supported by advances in technology has fundamentally challenged the current patterns of consumption and production in developing countries like India. In general, there is a lack of awareness in both private and public undertakings on how to improve efficiencies for sustainable practice and growth. Participants in this track will get a better understanding of design for sustainability concepts with focused action plans to advance sustainable product and services design in diverse fields ranging from governance to education. To further adapt, participants will be motivated by relevant examples and case studies from various organizations and economies to reverse current negative trends and come up with practical solutions to tackle this challenge.
