                <p style="text-align:justify;margin: 0 0 15px 0;"><img src="content/di14/tracks/Future_of_Banking.jpg" width="150px" height="150px" style="float:left;margin: 0px 10px 5px 0px;"/>Banking and managing money has come a long way. About four decades ago the ATM was invented to change the way we collected cash, while online banking in the 90s and 2000s gave a new dimension to our banking experience. But, how will the bank of the 21st century look like? What is the future of shopping and credit cards? Can mobile banking be pervasive and seamless? In this track we will create technologies to enable banking interactions as our physical and virtual worlds become intertwined, interfaces for the future of transactions over social and mobile networks and principles that will transform the banking in the next decade.

In this track, we would enable participants to build interesting applications using cameras.  We will explore technologies and designs that use cameras and displays in interesting ways: to capture 3D and 4D photographs, post-capture refocusing of images, glasses-free 3D displays, visual social networks, collaborative imaging and much more.

This has created incredible opportunities to connect with group of friends, colleagues and strangers in real-time. This track will focus on designing interfaces and experiences of groups of people on the move. We will explore how can we build systems with a strong social foundation to help people relate to each other, communicate, collaborate and play throughout the day.

Imagine the ability to add sensing capabilities such as multi-touch, proximity, pressure and light cheaply on top of any surface you wish. Imagine the possibility of turning any existing everyday object into your generic controller for multimedia applications (gaming, music) or automation systems (lighting, robotics). In this track, we will provide participants a broad introduction to state-of-the-art sensing techniques, interaction design and practical experience that will assist in developing and implementing such systems in their own work. Our goal is to create versatile tools that enable anyone to create their own devices for interfacing the real-world with the digital world. We will encourage participants to sketch and/or build prototypes based on open-source hardware and software.

This track proposes to explore engaging and playful technologies that can inspire curiosity and passion for learning in people. During the course of this track, we will brainstorm about ways in which kindergarten style of learning can be incorporated in all ages. This could include tinkering around with educational toolkits:  Makey-Makey and Scratch, rapidly prototyping technologies to foster creative learning, designing open learning platforms that could facilitate peer-led approach, making learning accessible to diverse populations!

Generate electricity from garbage? or using a smartphone to monitor health? Do you believe solution to big problems doesn't always have to be complicated and expensive? If so, come join the movement and become a Grassroot Engineer. A huge portion of Indiaâ€™s population still is engaged in agriculture and devoid of basic healthcare. We will aid farmers in developing tools such as smart irrigation technologies, weather forecast systems and crop health monitoring systems. We will also develop low cost healthcare systems for quick and affordable health care. We will make our own arduinos, shields, use open source software and hardware for rapid prototyping using only local resources.

In this track, we will provide you a broad introduction to sensor fusion techniques, interaction design along with the use of collaborative design through Pachisi board game to implement an interface to emphasize the interaction. By the end of the workshop you will be making amazing unpredictable machines!

In general, there is a lack of awareness in both private and public undertakings on how to improve efficiencies for sustainable practice and growth. Participants in this track will get a better understanding of design for sustainability concepts with focused action plans to advance sustainable product and services design in diverse fields ranging from governance to education. To further adapt, participants will be motivated by relevant examples and case studies from various organizations and economies to reverse current negative trends and come up with practical solutions to tackle this challenge.

Every motion has its origin, every sound has a cause. Nature works in a specific way and we learned to count on Nature. However we like to get surprised. As we explore and invent, we know that these moments of surprise are also the moments progress. We are fascinated by systems that do things that are against any sense making like a ball that rolls itself, a screen that can actuate itself, two bicycles that can fuse together to make a rickshaw, a shirt collar that converts to airbag for bikers during accident. In this track, weâ€™ll look at utility, technology, product and interface design from a perspective of magic, for its ability to surprise and please its users to tell a story about creativity and progress.

Manual fabrication involves using hand tools on a workpiece to make a desired object. Different cultures across the world have their own signature crafts in metalwork, woodwork, fabric, glass and ceramics to name a few. Digital fabrication is rapidly changing how we think about ideas and how we design and prototype them. 3D printers, CNC machines and laser cutters have made it very easy to realize a mechanical design. In this track we would explore the huge space of fabrication from the aspect of technologies to enable people to start experimenting and building with their ideas. This could include hacking 3D printers to print different materials, making simple mechanical tools that make straight line cutting easier, a better design for a breadboard, a way to etch circuit boards with little resources, universal opamp filter boards, universal gear kits, universal mechanical linkage kits and much more!
